## Learning Objectives
HW #3 will have you focus on making more progress towards completing your final assignment (HW #4). As a reminder, your final assignment is meant to combine all of the course learning outcomes(!):

- identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience
- prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that its appropriately formatted for building data visualizations
- build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically {ggplot2} + ggplot2 extension packages
- write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others
- apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations
- assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations


## Exercises and Questions

1. I plan to pursue Option 1.

2. Main Question: How does rain fall in Santa Barbara County?
  - The main question has stayed the same since homework 1 but the subquestions have morphed as I play with the data and how I can visualize it.
